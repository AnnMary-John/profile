        <h1>About <strong>Me</strong></h1>
        <p>I'm a passionate full-stack and mobile app developer who brings digital ideas to life with a blend of code
            and creativity. Specializing in Angular, .NET, and SQL, I thrive at the intersection of design and
            functionality — turning complex problems into smooth, intuitive user experiences.</p>
        <p>My journey started as a developer in 2021, and since then, I've dived deep into building scalable web
            and mobile applications. Whether it's crafting sleek UI, engineering efficient backends, or deploying
            polished products, I love the entire build cycle. Along the way, I’ve explored technologies like Flutter,
            React Native, and more — always staying curious and hungry to learn.</p>
        <p>When I’m not coding, I’m either catching a movie, going on a night ride, or enjoying ice cream while planning
            my next side project. You can find me on GitHub, where I share what I build, or catch glimpses of my journey
            on Dev.to.</p>
